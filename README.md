# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Data Analyst.

## About This Project

This portfolio is a fully responsive, single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an interactive interface with a dynamic 3D project showcase, a GitHub README previewer, and a clean, modern aesthetic.

The original template was created by [codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) and has been extensively customized to fit my specific needs as a data professional.
